# AlgoC

Playground repository containing collection of algorithms written in C.

"Unlike most computer languages, C allows the programmer to write directly to memory. Key constructs in C such as structs, pointers and arrays are designed to structure, and manipulate memory in an efficient, machine-independent fashion."

## Algorithms

### Sort

1. [BubbleSort](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/bubble_sort/bubble.c)
2. [Bucket Sort](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/bucket_sort/bucket.c)
3. [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/insertion_sort/insertion.c)
4. [Quick Sort](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/quick_sort/quick.c)

### Collectoion

1. [Hash table](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/hash_table_collection/table.c)
2. [Tries Tree](https://github.com/bartossh/AlgoC/blob/main/tries_collection/tries.c)
